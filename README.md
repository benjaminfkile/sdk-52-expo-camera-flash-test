## verifies camera flash does not work in expo-camera (~16.0.11) on sdk 52 running on android as of 3/4/2025

### I have tried expo go and development builds

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benjaminfkile/sdk-52-expo-camera-flash-test.git && cd sdk-52-expo-camera-flash-test && npm i && npx expo start
```
